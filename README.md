# wake-planetscale
Batch script that visits https://uni-spaces.vercel.app/ on startup, waking my Planetscale database.

### Installation (Windows only)
1. Clone this repo to the Documents folder
2. Copy the batch file and move it to the Windows startup folder
3. Frequently shut down computer so this actually gets used (because I never do)
